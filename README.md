SWAT is a rhythm game inspired by Friday Night Funkinâ€™, but with an Indian twist. Instead of arrows, players use slippers and a hit-can to match beats, set against a monsoon backdrop where insects swarm to the music playing from a radio. Sprites and animations were crafted in Aseprite, the layout in Figma, and the soundtrack composed on BeepBox.
